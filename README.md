# Learning Three.js

Experimenting with React apps that contain 3D environments with Physics engines.

## Experimenting with:
- [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) (3D library for JavaScript)
- [react-three-fibre](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (React wrapper for three.js)
- [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) (Physics engine for three.js environments)
- [use-cannon](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-cannon) (React hooks for cannon.js)
- [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) (Collection of helpers and abstractions for react-three-fibre)
